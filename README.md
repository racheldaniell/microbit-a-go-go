# microbit-a-go-go
repository related to experimentation with the MicroBit:Go microcontroller in the context of Pratt INFO697

The files here are intended to be flashed to a Micro:Bit to facilitate user interaction with that device.

Files run individually as stand-alone programs, except for those intended to be run as a set (which are incomplete draft code) ending in "_part1" "_part2" 


TECHNICAL NOTES:

Since development was done on MacOS, you may see a ".DSstore" file in the github repository, which can be ignored.
